- "mcp.testing" is not a valid module of the MCP SDK and no attempts should be made to add it to any testing.
- The AI keeps trying to add FastAPI, API, and HTTP related code despite "no-fastapi.xml" rules directing it not to, ensure nothing you create adds any references to these.
- This project should comprehensively review all available files to ensure that 1) objects exist and 2) objects have the attributes they should.
- I would recommend a review of the src files to assess, and then reviewing tests to ensure tests aren't written for non-existent attributes.
