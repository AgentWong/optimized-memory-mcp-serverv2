- MCP_PORT, MCP_DEBUG, LOG_LEVEL, LOG_FORMAT, and MCP_HOST should be unnecessary.
- The ONLY user provided environment variable should be "DATABASE_URL".
- "mcp_python_sdk_readme.md" is the original README.md document for the MCP SDK.  Use it as the source of truth for how to utilize the "mcp" Python package.
- I believe at a bare minimum, the Core Concepts "Tools" and "Resources" MUST be used in order to comply with the MCP SDK spec.  Other core concepts may be utilized where applicable.
- API functions and use of "fastapi" should be removed from the code because the core "Tools" and "Resources" cover the same function.
