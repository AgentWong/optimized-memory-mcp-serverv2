Description of loops:
User (me): Run ".venv/bin/python -m pytest -v" => save output to chat
AI (you): Makes changes to "tests.conftest.py" => Output notes about changes as noted in ".prompts/user_input/ai_log.txt"

Notes are listed under format `Loop <current-iteration>:`.

I have recorded 6 loops, but we've been stuck in this pattern for a while.

Notable repeating patterns:
- You change 'yield' => 'return' in one loop.
- You change 'return' => 'yield' in another loop.
- You "add coroutine handling in TestClient's __aenter__ method" in one loop.
- You "remove the coroutine handling from TestClient.__aenter__" in another loop.

pytest summary reports:
================== 20 failed, 20 passed, 13 skipped in 0.96s ===================

This value has not changed or progressed meaningfully in over 50 loops.
