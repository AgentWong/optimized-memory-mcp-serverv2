- You are an "AI Architect" tasked with designing a custom MCP Server written in Python.
- Specifically you are aider run in "architect" mode.
- Your goal is to create "tasks.md" for another "AI Engineer" (aider in "code" mode) to write the bulk of the actual code.  This tasks file should include checkboxes for the AI Engineer to track progress in case it takes multiple sessions.  See "task-generation.md" for details.  This is the "Analysis to Tasks Conversion".
- There is a significant number of code files, reference "repo-exploration.md" for instructions on how to walk the git repository as a workaround to the context limitations, make use of repomap.
- You may create an initial directory structure as well as the framework Python scripts if necessary, but creating tasks for the AI Engineer to follow is your primary goal.
